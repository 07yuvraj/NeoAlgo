</p>

## Overview
The goal of this project is to have in a single place all possible algorithms and data structures - in multiple languages. We aim to achieve this in a collaborative manner, so feel free to contribute in any way you want, just make sure to follow the contribution guidelines listed below.

## Contributing Guidelines
A good step-by-step is described below. There are two possible situations: 

* One, in which you are submitting code for a non-existing DS/Algo. In this case, you can just follow the process below.
* In case you want to submit an improvement to an existing algo, we prefer that you create an issue, describing in details your improvement. This will help others to analyze your contribution :)

Make sure your code works before submitting it :D 

1. Fork it (https://github.com/tesseractcoding/neoalgo/fork)
2. Create your feature branch (git checkout -b feature/fooBar)
3. Commit your changes (git commit -am 'Add some fooBar')
4. Push to the branch (git push origin feature/fooBar)
5. Create a new Pull Request
